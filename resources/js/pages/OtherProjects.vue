          I took part in the 2020 Advanced Hackathon, in which the task
          was to create an external applet which integrates with an existing 
          healthcare application. I worked as developer on our team,
          alongside some of the developers for CareNotes. We created an
          applet that integrates with CareNotes, a patient management
          system, to show patients on a ward, and record incidents,
          clinical notes, BMI and Bodymap forms against the patient.
          This would then use the existing CareNotes API to send this to
          CareNotes. The project was designed and built in 24 hours, in
          Advanced's MosaicJS framework. I created the modals, forms and
          bodymapping functionality. The project is being looked into
          further as something, that can be developed into a full product.

          I am currently running V2 of my portfolio, I have decided to make the website more readable, and remove some of the animations
          from <a href="./v1">V1</a>, to make it far more readable, and easy to follow. I have used Fullpage.JS to draw attention to each
          of my individual projects and remove clutter from the page.

          I have been working to make board games playable in Tabletop
          Simulator, so that people can continue playing during the
          Covid-19 outbreak. I created a fork of the Gloomhaven Fantasy
          set-up mod, and scripted all of the Forgotten Circles
          expansion and solo scenarios in lua with
          <a
            href="https://curtisreet.co.uk"
            title="CurtPortfolio"
          >Curtis Reet</a>. My mod has now been merged into the original mod, where I
          have been credited, which is the most popular tabletop
          simulator mod with over 100,000 active users

          I was the original leader on the Portal 2 mod Portal Stores:
          Mel. The mod went on to win a Video Game Award for "Best Fan
          Creation" in 2015, and has been given a full steam release,
          with overwhelmingly positive reviews. I am in the credits of
          the mod for my past contributions. The mod featured in news
          articles on various news websites, such as the washington post.

          I host a Minecraft server for VR users. The server is a
          nightclub for VR users, and features a custom scripted beat
          detection system. The beat detection uses a C application,
          which acts as the API, using the GBD Framework. In the game, I
          have used the Computercraft Mod, to make a lua application
          which gets the beat information from the API, which keeps the
          lights in sync with the music. The club was created as a
          meeting place for people during Covid-19.
